This code is a part of a project for my intro to Machine Learning course I am taking in the Winter of 2021 at Northwestern University. Files written by myself include: decision_tree.py, data.py, experiment.py, metrics.py, and prior probability.py. These files together take in an excel sheet, load the data, and develop, fit, and train a decision tree on the loaded data. From there it is able to take in new examples and classify them using the decision tree algorithm. Additionally, I have implemented a simplistic prior probability algorithm that can be used to train and classify data on as well. The metrics.py runs data analysis on the classifications the decision tree makes and reports its accuracy.
